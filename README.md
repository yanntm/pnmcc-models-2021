# pnmcc-models-2021

Extracted models + *formulas* + oracles where available based on [MCC'2021](http://mcc.lip6.fr) Model Checking Competition.

This project automatically extracts and produces separate archives for each model of the competition, along with "oracle" files that describe the expected values as computed in "expected" by consensus among the competing tools in 2021.

The files are distributed here : [Generated Page](https://yanntm.github.io/pnmcc-models-2021/index.html) as 

* a set of individual model instances and formulas, packaged as a tar.gz per instance.
* a single archive [oracle.tgz](https://yanntm.github.io/pnmcc-models-2021/oracle.tar.gz) containing all consensus property verdicts 
 and a set of *StateSpace* examination verdict files built from the results of 2021 gold medalist in the category Tedd. 
 Note the oracles may contain "partial" oracles that contain a question mark `?` for unknown answers that were asked in the contest. 
 These `?` queries should be harder to solve, and we do not have a consensus/accepted answer in 2021.
 
The intent is to use these files for development and regression testing of any competing tool. 
In particular, these files are used for regression and performance testing of [ITS-Tools](http://ddd.lip6.fr), see this [companion GitHub project](https://github.com/yanntm/pnmcc-tests) that uses these files to run tests.
 
## Content of oracle files

The oracle files are simply a "virtual" trace of a correct answer of a tool, in expected MCC format. 
The first line defines the model instance and examination, then the results are provided with "ORACLE2021" as technique used.

e.g.

```
ARMCacheCoherence-PT-none ReachabilityFireability
FORMULA ARMCacheCoherence-PT-none-ReachabilityFireability-00 FALSE TECHNIQUES ORACLE2021
FORMULA ARMCacheCoherence-PT-none-ReachabilityFireability-01 FALSE TECHNIQUES ORACLE2021
FORMULA ARMCacheCoherence-PT-none-ReachabilityFireability-02 TRUE TECHNIQUES ORACLE2021
FORMULA ARMCacheCoherence-PT-none-ReachabilityFireability-03 FALSE TECHNIQUES ORACLE2021
... file shortened...
```

## Sources and notes

The files produced by this project are created using the official archives taken from the [MCC website](https://mcc.lip6.fr/archives/), we basically decompress the virtual machine image to extract the model + formula files, 
and use some perl tricks on the "raw_results.csv" to create the oracle files. All the files building this oracle live in this repository and can be inspected.

The traces for StateSpace examination are built using all complete verdicts from 2020 gold medalist Tedd, because the "raw_results.csv" cannot be used as large numbers (e.g. state count) are shortened.
We used the "collect_tedd.sh" script that lives in this repo to build these oracles, but we did this offline since our CI provider is not generous enough that we could download and decompress the full logs from the contest.
Note that Tedd had a 100% reliability score, so these values should be trustable.  
Currently we have not yet updated these files, so these are verdicts from the 2020 edition of the contest.

We currently rename a bunch of formulas whose name is inconsistent/not homogeneous. 
We enforce the rule that every formula name is unique at the benchmark scale for Reachability and LTL queries in particular.
The name of the formula is thus always formed of "MODELINSTANCE-EXAMINATION-ID".
Reachability queries in 2021 could have arbitrary MODELINSTANCE in some cases, and LTL queries were missing the EXAMINATION part.

We have a similar project to host the files for previous years, going back to 2017,e.g. https://github.com/yanntm/pnmcc-models-2020
These repositories are curated, consensus verdicts that are incorrect are diagnosed and patched (see the edits made in the https://github.com/yanntm/pnmcc-models-2021/blob/master/install_inputs.sh#L57 script).
